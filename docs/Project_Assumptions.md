# Project Assumptions & Defaults

**Project**: 80ft River/Nearshore Cruiser
**Status**: Active Assumptions for Engineering

## 1. Mission Profile (Inputs for Engineering)
* **Operation**: 90% River (Displacement speed), 10% Nearshore (Good weather).
* **Crew**: Owner-operator + occasional deckhand (2 total).
* **Guests**: Up to 20 for day trips, 6-8 overnight.
* **Maintenance**: "Fix it anywhere" philosophy using standard parts.

## 2. Dimensional Defaults (Placeholders for Calculation)
* **LOA**: 24.0 m
* **LWL**: ~23.5 m (Plumb bow assumption)
* **Beam**: 6.2 m (Molded)
* **Draft**: 1.3 m (Design Draft), 1.5 m (Max Navigational)
* **Depth**: ~3.0 m (Keel to Main Deck)
* **Air Draft**: < 7.0 m (Bridge clearance check needed?) - *TBD*
* **Displacement**: ~35-40 tonnes (Lightship Target)

## 3. Structural Assumptions
* **Material**: FRP (Polyester/Vinylester Resin + E-Glass).
* **Method**: Hand lay-up for hull (Low capex), Vacuum bag/Infusion optional for deck (Weight save).
* **Scantlings**: ISO 12215 or VR River Rules (whichever is safer/applicable).
* **Symmetry**: Hull is symmetric fore-aft of parallel midbody? No, symmetric Port-Stbd. (Clarification: Standard monohull symmetry).

## 4. Systems Defaults
* **Voltage**: 220V AC 50Hz (Primary), 24V DC (Control/Start/Nav).
* **Water**: River water filtration for non-potable; Tank for potable.
* **Propulsion**: EREV Series Hybrid (Diesel Gen -> Battery -> E-Motor). *Note: treated as "Black Box" weight/cost for now.*

## 5. Costing Assumptions
* **Labor Rate**: Vietnam local shipyard rates (Tier 2 yard).
* **Material Sourcing**: Local distributors where possible; Import for safety-critical (Resin/Core).
* **Waste Factor**: 15% for Laminate.
