# COMP-MIN: Minimum Compliance & Certification Strategy

**Version:** v0.1 (Concept)
**Owner:** Regulatory Consultant
**Status:** Draft / Gate 6
**Context:** Vietnam River + Nearshore Operation (Private/Non-Commercial Assumption)

---

## 1. Compliance Philosophy

We aim for **"Safe Operation"** compliance rather than full "Class Society" (Lloyds/DNV) notation which is too expensive. We target compliance with local **Vietnam Register (VR)** standards for "River Ships" (SI/SII) or "Pleasure Craft" category.

### 1.1 Targeted Classification
- **Primary**: VR Inland Waterway (River) - Level SI or SII.
- **Secondary**: Coastal limitation (e.g. max 12nm from shore, wave < 2m).

## 2. Documentation Package (The "As-Built" Book)

Authorities/Insurers require proof of what was built.

### Essential Drawings (Must Have)
1.  **General Arrangement (GA)**: Shows exits, fire extinguisher locations, capacity.
2.  **Structural Plan**: Midship section, laminate schedule used.
3.  **Electrical Diagram**: Single line diagram (AC & DC) showing fuses/breakers.
4.  **Stability Booklet**:
    - Hydrostatics.
    - Inclining Test Report (GM verification).
    - Maximum Load conditions.

### Certificates
1.  **Engine/Genset EIAPP**: Emission certs (if applicable).
2.  **Life Raft**: Annual inspection cert.
3.  **Fire Extinguishers**: Service tags.

## 3. Operational Limitations (The "Plaque")

A bridge plaque must state:

> **OPERATIONAL LIMITS**
> - **Max Pax**: 12 Guests + Crew (or as defined by life saving appliances).
> - **Max Wave Height**: 1.5m (Significant).
> - **Max Wind**: Beaufort 4.
> - **Area**: Inland Waters & Coastal < 12nm from safe haven.
> - **Daylight Only**: (Unless nav lights certified).

## 4. Surveyor Sign-Off Points

We recommend engaging a local surveyor (VR or Independent) at these stages:

1.  **Hull Release**: Verify laminate thickness matches drawing.
2.  **Watertight Test**: Witness flood/hose test of bulkheads.
3.  **Inclining Test**: Witness the stability test on launch.
4.  **Sea Trial**: Verify steering, bilge pumps, and speed.

## 5. Safety Equipment Checklist (VR Minimums)

- [ ] **Life Jackets**: 150N Solas type (1 per person + 10%).
- [ ] **Life Buoys**: 2x Ring buoys (one with light).
- [ ] **Fire Fighting**:
    - Engine Room: Fixed auto-extinguisher (FM200 or Powder).
    - Galley: Fire blanket + CO2.
    - Cabins: 2kg Powder.
- [ ] **Comms**: VHF Radio (Fixed) + Handheld backup.
- [ ] **Signals**: Flares (Red hand, Parachute, Smoke).
- [ ] **Anchor**: Main anchor + chain (as per Equipment Number calc).

## 6. Open Questions for Owner

- **OQ-REG-01**: Will this be a "Commercial Charter" or "Private"? (Commercial requires far stricter fire/stability rules).
- **OQ-REG-02**: Exact registration port? (Local interpretations vary).
