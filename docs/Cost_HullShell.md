## 1. Cost Summary (3 Scenarios)

Based on TDD-Structure (Solid Bottom, Sandwich Sides) and Local VN Labor Rates ($5/hr).

| Scenario | Description | Material Cost | Labor Cost | Tooling | Total (USD) | Variance |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **S1: Safe Minimum** | All Poly Resin, Balsa Core (Decks), Rough Finish. | $32,000 | $10,000 | $4,000 | **$46,000** | -34% (Good) |
| **S2: Balanced** (Rec) | VE Skin Coat, PVC Core, Standard Finish. | $39,800 | $15,000 | $5,000 | **$59,800** | -14% (Good) |
| **S3: Premium** | Infusion, Full VE, Yacht Finish. | $55,000 | $25,000 | $15,000| **$95,000** | +35% (FAIL) |

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Scenario S2 (Balanced)**. It fits safely within the $70k cap (~$60k estimate) leaving $10k contingency, while providing osmosis protection (VE skin) and rot-proof core (PVC).

## 2. Key Cost Drivers & Risks

### 2.1 Material Volatility
- **Resin Prices**: Highly volatile oil derivative.
- *Mitigation*: Lock in drum price early or buy in bulk (25 drums) at project start.

### 2.2 Labor Efficiency
- **Risk**: "Vietnamese time" - labor hours blowing out due to rework or curing delays.
- *Mitigation*: Pay by **milestone** (completed hull stage) rather than by hour.

### 2.3 Tooling Trap
- **Risk**: Building a "perfect mold" for a one-off boat.
- *Mitigation*: **Direct Female Mold** (MDF/Ply) or **Male Plug + Panel** method. Do NOT build a Class A production mold.

## 3. Bill of Quantities (BoQ) Analysis

See `docs/BoQ_HullShell.csv` for line items.

- **Resin + Glass**: ~60% of Material Cost.
- **Core**: ~15% of Material Cost (PVC is expensive).
- **Labor**: ~20-25% of Total Cost (Low labor rate is our competitive advantage).

### Breakdown (S2 Baseline)
- **Materials**: ~$40k
- **Labor**: ~$15k
- **Tooling**: ~$5k
- **Total**: ~$60k

## 4. Cash Flow Plan (Hull Phase)
1.  **Month 1**: Tooling materials + 50% Resin/Glass order ($20k).
2.  **Month 2**: Labor payments (Frames/Jigs) ($5k).
3.  **Month 3**: 50% Resin/Glass + Core ($20k).
4.  **Month 4**: Labor payments (Lamination) ($10k).

*Note: This fits the "Phased" approach.*
