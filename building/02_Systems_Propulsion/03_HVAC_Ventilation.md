# WORK INSTRUCTION: HVAC & Ventilation

**ID:** BLD-02-03
**Role:** HVAC Tech / Electrician
**Time Est:** 5 Days
**Prerequisites:** Interior framing started

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE
Make the boat breathable. Engine needs air to burn, Humans need air to breathe (and stay cool).

---

## 2. TOOLS & SAFETY

### Safety Gear
*   **Gloves**: Sheet metal is sharp. Aluminum tape cuts fingers.

### Tools
- [ ] Duct Tape (Aluminum foil type).
- [ ] Zip Ties (Large).
- [ ] Drill.

## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Engine Room Blowers
**Worker:** Tech
**Action:**
Install big fans to suck heat out and push fresh air in.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Intake**: Duct must end **low** in the engine room (Cool air sinks? No, but combustion air is needed low).
2.  **Extract**: Duct must start **high** (Heat rises). Suck the hot air out.
3.  **Fire Flap**: Install a damper that slams shut if fire melts the fuse.
    *   *Test*: Manually trip the flap. Does it seal?

### STEP 2: AC Ducting
**Worker:** Tech
**Action:**
Run the insulated tubes for Air Con.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Straight**: Keep ducts straight. Bends kill airflow.
2.  **Tight**: Tape every joint with Aluminum foil tape. No air leaks!
3.  **Insulate**: The duct is cold. The air is hot. If not insulated, it sweats (Condensation) -> Rotting wood.
    *   *Check*: Is the silver insulation torn? Tape it.

### STEP 3: Condensate Drains (The Silent Killer)
**Worker:** Plumber/Tech
**Action:**
Where does the water from the AC unit go?

**Instruction:**
1.  **Gravity**: Water flows down. The drain hose must slope down all the way.
2.  **Discharge**:
    *   *Option A*: Overboard (Best).
    *   *Option B*: Sump Box (Pump out).
    *   *NEVER*: Into the bilge (Makes bilge smelly/wet).

## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **Air Flow**: Turn on fan. Put hand over vent. Strong breeze?
*   [ ] **Water Test**: Pour a cup of water into the AC drip tray. Does it drain away rapidly?
*   [ ] **Noise**: Is the fan vibrating? Add rubber washers.

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **Crushed Ducts**: Squeezing a 6" duct through a 4" hole. No air comes out.
*   **U-Traps**: Hose goes down then up. Water gets trapped -> Mold/Bacteria.
