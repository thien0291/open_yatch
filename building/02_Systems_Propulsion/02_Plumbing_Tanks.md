## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Seacocks (The Holes in the Bottom)
**Worker:** Plumber
**Action:**
Install the valves that let water in/out. **DANGER: If this fails, boat sinks.**

**Instruction:**
1.  **Drill**: Cut hole size = Fitting size (snug fit).
2.  **Backing Plate**: Glue a plywood/G10 ring inside hull for strength.
3.  **Sealant**: Apply Sikaflex 291 to the mushroom head and threads.
4.  **Tighten**: Screw the nut from inside.
    *   *Rule*: Handle of valve must be accessible.
    *   *Orient*: Handle points UP when open (usually).

### STEP 2: Tank Install
**Worker:** Plumber + Helper
**Action:**
Secure the heavy tanks.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Clean**: Vacuum the tank. Debris kills pumps.
2.  **Place**: Put tank on neoprene rubber strips (No chafing).
3.  **Secure**: Use polyester straps or timber cleats.
    *   *Test*: Push it. If it moves, it's loose. A full tank weighs 500kg+.

### STEP 3: Pipe Runs (PEX / Hoses)
**Worker:** Plumber
**Action:**
Connect A to B.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Color Code**:
    *   Blue = Cold Fresh Water.
    *   Red = Hot Fresh Water.
    *   White (Sanitation) = Toilet (Odor safe).
    *   Clear wire reinforced = Bilge/Sea Water.
2.  **Double Clamp**: Any hose below waterline needs 2 hose clamps.
    *   *Align*: 180 degrees apart (Screws on opposite sides).
3.  **Anti-Siphon**: Toilet discharge must loop UP above waterline with a vent valve.

## 4. QA CHECKLIST (The "Leak Hunt")

*   [ ] **Pressure Test**: Pump fresh water system to 60 PSI. Wait 1 hour. Gauge drop?
    *   *Drop = Leak.* Find it.
*   [ ] **Buckets**: Fill tanks with buckets first (don't use hose yet). Check for leaks at bottom fittings.
*   [ ] **Siphon Breaks**: Are they installed on toilet and engine cooling?
*   [ ] **Bilge Pumps**: Pour water in bilge. Does pump turn on? Does it pump out?

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **Using wrong hose**: Using clear water hose for Diesel. Diesel eats clear hose -> Fire.
*   **Overtightening plastic fittings**: They crack. Hand tight + 1/4 turn.
*   **No Loop**: Toilet flushes... and sea water keeps coming in. Sinks boat.
