**ID:** BLD-02-01
**Role:** Mechanic + Assistant
**Time Est:** 10 Days
**Prerequisites:** Engine Bed Laminated, Engine on Stand

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE
Install the Engine, Shaft, and Propeller. The alignment must be perfect (less than 0.05mm error) or the boat will shake itself to pieces.

---

## 2. TOOLS & SAFETY

### Safety Gear
*   **Steel Toe Boots**: Engines are heavy. If it drops, you lose toes.
*   **Gloves**: Oil and grease protection.

### Tools

## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: The Stern Tube (The Hole in the Boat)
**Worker:** Mechanic
**Action:**
Install the tube that holds the shaft.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Slide In**: Push the fiberglass Stern Tube through the hull hole.
2.  **Align**: Use a string or laser from the Engine Bed center to the Rudder center. The tube must be centered on this line.
3.  **Glue**: Resin/Glass the tube into the hull. **Make sure it is watertight.**

### STEP 2: Dropping the Engine
**Worker:** Crane Operator + Mechanic
**Action:**
Lower the beast.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Lift**: Attach chains to the lifting eyes on the engine. **NEVER** lift by the manifolds.
2.  **Lower**: Slowly lower onto the Flexible Mounts.
3.  **Secure**: Hand-tighten the nuts. Do not torque yet.

### STEP 3: Alignment (The Hard Part)
**Worker:** Mechanic
**Action:**
Make the Engine output face parallel to the Shaft face.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Mate**: Slide the propeller shaft coupling up to the engine gearbox coupling.
2.  **Gap Check**: Use Feeler Gauges.
    *   Insert gauge between the two metal faces.
    *   Check Top, Bottom, Left, Right.
    *   **Goal**: The gap difference must be < 0.05mm (Paper thickness).
3.  **Adjust**: Turn the nuts on the engine mounts to go Up/Down. Slide engine Left/Right.
4.  **Repeat**: Check -> Adjust -> Check -> Adjust. This takes hours. Be patient.

           v
         Bottom
         
    Rule: Top Gap = Bottom Gap (+/- 0.05mm)
```

### STEP 4: Exhaust System
**Worker:** Mechanic
**Action:**
Don't let the ocean flow back into the engine.

**Instruction:**
1.  **High Loop**: The exhaust hose must go UP high (above waterline) right after the engine.
2.  **Waterlock**: Install the plastic muffler box at the lowest point.
3.  **Clamps**: Use TWO stainless steel clamps on every connection.

## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **Torque**: Engine mount nuts tightened to spec (e.g., 150 Nm)?
*   [ ] **Alignment**: Final Feeler Gauge check recorded?
*   [ ] **Shaft Seal**: Is the PSS/Stuffing box clamped tight?
*   [ ] **Propeller Key**: Did you install the keyway before the prop nut?
*   [ ] **Cotter Pin**: Is the prop nut locked with a pin?

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **"Soft Foot"**: One engine mount leg is not touching the bed firmly. (Like a wobbly table).
*   **Lifting by Plastic Parts**: Breaking sensors/covers during crane lift.
