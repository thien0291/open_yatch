# WORK INSTRUCTION: Insulation & Lining

**ID:** BLD-04-01
**Role:** General Worker / Carpenter
**Time Est:** 7 Days
**Prerequisites:** Wires/Plumbing tested. Boat watertight.

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE
Stop the boat from sweating (Condensation) and keep the noise down.

---

## 2. TOOLS & SAFETY

### Safety Gear
*   **Mask (P2)**: Glue fumes and insulation dust.
*   **Gloves**: Contact adhesive is sticky and toxic.

## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Thermal Insulation (The Foam)
**Worker:** General Worker
**Action:**
Stick the black foam (Armaflex) to the hull.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Clean**: Acetone wipe the fiberglass.
2.  **Glue**: Apply contact adhesive to BOTH the hull and the foam sheet.
    *   *Wait*: Wait until "tacky" (touch it, if it lifts on your finger, wait longer).
3.  **Stick**: Press it on.
    *   *Rule*: **NO GAPS**. A 1mm gap = Water drip on owner's head.
4.  **Tape**: Use foam tape over every seam.

### STEP 2: The Sub-Structure (Battens)
**Worker:** Carpenter
**Action:**
Glue wood strips to the foam/hull to hold the panels.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Material**: Marine Plywood strips (12mm).
2.  **Glue**: Use Sikaflex (flexible glue).
    *   *Note*: Don't screw into the hull! (You might make a hole in the boat).
3.  **Level**: Use the laser. The hull is curved, but the ceiling must look flat. Shim the battens level.

### STEP 3: Wall & Ceiling Panels (The Pretty Part)
**Worker:** Carpenter / Upholsterer
**Action:**
Cover the ugly foam.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Fastening**: Use "Fastmount" clips (Invisible clips) or Velcro.
    *   *Why?* You need to take the panel off later to fix a wire.
2.  **Fabric Wrap**: Stretch vinyl/fabric over the plywood panel. Staple on the back.
    *   *Corner*: Fold the corner neatly (Hospital corner).

## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **Insulation Check**: Look for any fiberglass showing. Cover it.
*   [ ] **Panel Gap**: Are the gaps between panels even (e.g., 3mm)?
*   [ ] **Removability**: Can you actually pull the panel off?

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **"The Bridge"**: Leaving a metal screw connecting the cold hull to the warm room. Water will drip from the screw head.
*   **Gluing Panels**: Gluing the ceiling panels permanently. You WILL regret this when a light breaks.
