### STEP 2: Bonding (No Screws)
**Worker:** Carpenter
**Action:**
Glue the furniture to the hull.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Tab**: Use fiberglass tape to bond the inside of the cabinet to the hull.
    *   *Strength*: This makes the furniture part of the structure.
2.  **Clean**: Clean the hull grind area first.

---

### STEP 3: Doors & Latches
**Worker:** Carpenter
**Action:**
Stop things flying out.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Push Locks**: Install "Push-to-Close" latches.
    *   *Test*: Slam the door. Does it latch?
    *   *Test*: Pull hard. Does it open without pushing the button? (It shouldn't).
2.  **Hinges**: Use soft-close hinges (prevents slamming fingers).

---

## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **Scribe Check**: No gap > 1mm against the hull.
*   [ ] **Latch Test**: Open/Close every drawer and door 5 times.
*   [ ] **Sharp Edges**: Run hand over every corner. Sand it smooth. (Boats move, people fall).

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **Square Corners**: Furniture corners should be rounded. If you fall into a sharp corner at sea, it hurts.
*   **No Ventilation**: Lockers need air holes. Wet lifejackets + No Air = Mold.
