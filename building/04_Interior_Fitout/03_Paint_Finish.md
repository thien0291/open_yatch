## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **Runs**: Any paint drips? (Sand and polish).
*   [ ] **Waterline**: Is it straight?

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **Painting over Tape**: Remove tape while paint is wet (or very carefully cut it). If dry, it rips the paint edge.
*   **Dust**: Painting in a dirty room. One speck of dust ruins a mirror finish.
