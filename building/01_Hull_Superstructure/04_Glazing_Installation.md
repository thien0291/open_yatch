---

## 2. TOOLS & SAFETY

### Safety Gear
*   **Suction Cups**: Heavy duty (Glass is heavy and slippery).
*   **Cut-resistant Gloves**: Glass edges are razors.

### Tools
- [ ] Caulking Gun (Battery powered is best for smooth beads).
- [ ] Spacers (Rubber blocks).

## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: The Dry Fit
**Worker:** 2 People
**Action:**
Check if the glass fits the hole.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Place**: Put the glass in the recess.
2.  **Gap Check**: You need a 4mm - 6mm gap all around for the sealant.
3.  **Spacers**: Place rubber blocks at the bottom to hold the glass up.

### STEP 2: Surface Preparation (CRITICAL)
**Worker:** Specialist
**Action:**
If you fail here, the window falls out.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Clean**: Clean Glass and FRP with Glass Cleaner.
2.  **Activator**: Wipe with Activator. Wait 5 mins.
3.  **Primer**: Paint the **Black Primer** on the FRP bond line and the Glass border.
    *   *Why?* The primer protects the glue from UV sun (Sun eats glue) and makes it stick.
    *   *Wait*: Let primer dry for 30 mins.

### STEP 3: Bonding
**Worker:** Specialist
**Action:**
Glue it.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Dam Tape**: Stick a foam tape on the inside edge of the glass. This stops glue from oozing inside the boat.
2.  **Apply Glue**: Apply a tall triangle bead of adhesive (Sika 296) on the glass (on top of the primer).
3.  **Install**: Lift glass with suction cups. Press into place.
4.  **Squeeze**: Push until it hits the spacers. DO NOT push too hard.

### STEP 4: Weather Seal (The "Pretty" Seal)
**Worker:** Specialist
**Action:**
Fill the outside gap.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Fill**: Fill the 5mm gap between glass and boat with black sealant.
2.  **Tooling**: Use a soapy stick to smooth the sealant flush with the glass.
3.  **Clean**: Peel off masking tape immediately.

---

## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **Adhesion Test**: Keep a small sample of the glue on a test piece. After 3 days, try to peel it. It should rip the rubber, not peel off.
*   [ ] **Visual**: Look from inside. The black glue line should be solid. No bubbles.
*   [ ] **Hose Test**: Spray water HARD. Check inside for drips.

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **Touching Primer**: Do not touch the black primer with fingers. Oils ruin it.
*   **No Spacers**: The glass slides down and touches the fiberglass. It will crack when the boat hits a wave.
