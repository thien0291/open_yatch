# WORK INSTRUCTION: Structure & Grid Installation

**ID:** BLD-01-02
**Role:** Carpentry & Lamination Team
**Time Est:** 15 Days
**Prerequisites:** Hull Shell Cured & Sanded

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE
Install the "skeleton" of the boat (Stringers and Bulkheads). This makes the floppy hull stiff and strong.

---

## 2. TOOLS & SAFETY

### Safety Gear
*   **Dust Mask (P2/N95)**: Grinding dust is itchy and bad for lungs.
*   **Ear Defenders**: Grinders are LOUD.

### Tools
- [ ] Laser Level
- [ ] Tape Measure
- [ ] Angle Grinder (Flap disc 40 grit)
- [ ] Mixing Boards (for putty)
- [ ] Fillet Radius Tool (Spoon or PVC pipe section)

## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Surface Prep (The "Key")
**Worker:** Grinder Man
**Action:**
Resin does not stick to shiny surfaces. You must scratch it.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Mark**: Draw the grid lines on the hull floor using the drawings.
2.  **Grind**: Grind the hull surface where the stringers will go.
    *   *Width*: Grind 100mm wider than the stringer on both sides.
    *   *Result*: Surface should look white and chalky. No shiny spots!
3.  **Clean**: Vacuum the dust. Acetone wipe.

   Grind this: [////////////]  <-- 100mm extra width
   Hull:       __________________
```

### STEP 2: Stringer Install (Longitudinal Beams)
**Worker:** Carpenter + Laminator
**Action:**
Glue down the foam cores and glass them over.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Bedding**: Mix resin + Cabosil (powder) -> Peanut Butter consistency.
2.  **Apply**: Trowel the paste onto the hull line.
3.  **Place**: Push the foam stringer core into the paste.
    *   *Check*: Paste must squeeze out the sides. No air under foam!
4.  **Fillet**: Use the radius tool to smooth the squeezed-out paste into a curve.
    *   *Why?* Glass cannot bend 90 degrees. It needs a curve.

   Hull Surface
   
   BAD:  __| |__  <-- Sharp corner. Glass will break here.
```

### STEP 3: Bulkhead Fit-up (The Walls)
**Worker:** Carpenter
**Action:**
Install the plywood/composite walls.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Fit**: Put bulkhead in place.
2.  **The Gap**: The hard plywood MUST NOT touch the hull shell.
    *   *Rule*: Maintain a 5-10mm gap. Use foam wedges or foam tape.
    *   *Why?* If the hull flexes and hits the hard wood, the hull cracks (Hard Spot).
3.  **Tab**: Use the same Fillet method as stringers. Then apply Glass Tapes.

### STEP 4: Tabbing (The Tape)
**Worker:** Laminator
**Action:**
Attach the structure to the hull with glass strips.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Sequence**: Apply tapes from narrow to wide.
    *   Layer 1: 100mm wide (Centered on corner).
    *   Layer 2: 200mm wide.
    *   Layer 3: 300mm wide.
2.  **Wet Out**: Use rollers. Remove air from the corner fillet.

   1 = First Tape (Narrow)
   2 = Second Tape (Medium)
   3 = Third Tape (Wide)
```

## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **No Hard Spots**: Can you pass a credit card under the bulkhead (if foam wasn't there)?
*   [ ] **Fillets**: Are they smooth? No jagged edges?
*   [ ] **White patches**: White in the corner = Air. Grind it out and redo.
*   [ ] **Vertical**: Is the bulkhead 90 degrees to the waterline?

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **Dry Corners**: Not pushing the glass deep enough into the resin fillet.
*   **Dirty Grind**: Bonding to shiny glass. It will peel off later.

**Next Step:** Once grid is done, prepare for [03_Deck_Superstructure](./03_Deck_Superstructure.md).
