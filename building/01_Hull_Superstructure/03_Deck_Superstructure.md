# WORK INSTRUCTION: Deck Construction & Joining

**ID:** BLD-01-03
**Role:** Lamination Team + Assembly Team
**Time Est:** 15 Days
**Prerequisites:** Hull Structure Complete, Deck Mold Ready

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE
Build the "Lid" of the boat and glue it to the Hull. This turns the open canoe into a yacht.

---

## 2. TOOLS & SAFETY

### Safety Gear
*   **Harness**: If working on top of the mold/deck (Fall risk).
*   **Respirator**: For Adhesive fumes (Methacrylate smells very strong).

### Tools
- [ ] Caulking Guns (Pneumatic preferred).
- [ ] C-Clamps (Many! 50+).
- [ ] Drill & Countersink bit.
- [ ] Torque Wrench.
- [ ] Cranes / Hoist.

## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Deck Lamination (Upside Down)
**Worker:** Laminator
**Action:**
Same as Hull, but with special "Inserts".

**Instruction:**
1.  **Gelcoat/Skin**: Apply as per Hull.
2.  **Core Check**: Before putting in the core foam, check the plan for "Hardware Spots".
    *   *Rule*: NEVER put soft foam where a cleat or winch goes.
    *   *Action*: Use Solid Glass or Plywood/G10 inserts at these spots.
3.  **Laminate**: Finish the inner skin.
4.  **Cable Trays**: Glue in PVC pipes for wires now (while upside down). It's easier than overhead work later!

    | [SOLID] |   <-- Hard Insert (Plywood/G10)
    |_________|
   
   [ Foam Core ]  <-- Soft Foam (Rest of deck)
```

### STEP 2: The "Dry Fit" (Trial Run)
**Worker:** Assembly Team
**Action:**
Make sure the lid fits the box.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Lift**: Crane the deck over the hull.
2.  **Lower**: Gently lower it onto the hull flange.
3.  **Check Gap**: Walk around the edge.
    *   *Ideal*: A consistent 3-5mm gap for glue.
    *   *Bad*: Touching (Grind it down) or Huge Gap (Shim it).
4.  **Mark**: Mark the alignment with a sharpie on Hull and Deck.

### STEP 3: The "Shoebox" Join (The Big Glue Up)
**Worker:** Full Team (All hands on deck!)
**Action:**
Glue them together. You have 45 minutes before glue sets!

**Instruction:**
1.  **Clean**: Acetone wipe both flanges.
2.  **Adhesive**: Apply a thick bead of Structural Adhesive (Plexus/Sika) on the HULL flange.
    *   *Shape*: Pyramid shape bead is best.
3.  **Lower**: Drop the deck onto the glue.
4.  **Clamp**: Apply clamps every 300mm.
    *   *Check*: You MUST see glue squeezing out everywhere. No squeeze-out = Leak.
5.  **Fasten**: Drill and screw/bolt through the flange while wet (if designed for bolts).

         [ Hull ]
   
   If you see glue here ^ it is watertight.
```

### STEP 4: Interior Tab (The "Belt and Braces")
**Worker:** Laminator
**Action:**
Glass the joint from the inside for safety.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Go Inside**: Enter the dark hull.
2.  **Fillet**: Smooth the squeeze-out glue into a radius.
3.  **Tape**: Apply 2 layers of Biaxial Tape over the seam.

---

## 4. QA CHECKLIST

*   [ ] **Squeeze-out**: Is there a continuous bead of glue all around the outside?
*   [ ] **Tapping**: Tap the deck hardware spots. Do they sound solid?
*   [ ] **Water Test**: After cure, spray the rail with a hose. Check inside for leaks.

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **"Missing the Insert"**: Putting foam where a winch goes. When you bolt the winch, the deck crushes.
*   **"Dry Joint"**: Not enough glue. Water will leak into the cabin forever.

**Next Step:** Once watertight, proceed to [04_Glazing_Installation](./04_Glazing_Installation.md).
