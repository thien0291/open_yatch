# WORK INSTRUCTION: Hull Lamination (Shell)

**ID:** BLD-01-01
**Role:** Lamination Team (Lead + 3 Laminators + 1 Runner)
**Time Est:** 10 Days Continuous
**Prerequisites:** Mold Released, Materials at Station

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE
Create the main body of the boat. This is a chemical process. Once started, we cannot stop until a layer is done. **Mistakes here cannot be undone easily.**

---

## 2. TOOLS & SAFETY

### Safety Gear - CRITICAL
*   **Tyvek Suit**: Full body protection.
*   **Respirator**: Organic Vapor Cartridge (Black/Yellow band). **No Dust Masks!**
*   **Goggles**: Sealed eye protection (Splashing resin blinds you).

### Tools
- [ ] Aluminum Rollers (Finned) - For removing air.
- [ ] Mohair Rollers (Fabric) - For applying resin.
- [ ] Catalyst Dispenser (Calibrated).
- [ ] Wet Film Gauge (For Gelcoat).
- [ ] Scissors (Keep them clean!).
- [ ] 10L Buckets.

## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Mold Prep & Release (The "Non-Stick" Layer)
**Worker:** Lead Laminator
**Action:**
Make sure the boat doesn't stick to the mold forever.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Clean**: Wipe mold with clean rags. No dust.
2.  **Wax**: Apply Release Wax in circular motion. Let haze. Buff off. Repeat **5 times**.
3.  **PVA (Optional)**: If mold is old, spray green PVA film.

**VISUAL GUIDE: WAXING**

   Apply Wax:  (( @ ))  <-- Circular Motion
   Wait 5 min:  ( Haze )
   Buff Off:   <--\-->  <-- Clean Towel, linear motion
   
   REPEAT x 5 !!
```

### STEP 2: Gelcoat Application (The "Paint")
**Worker:** Spray Gun Operator
**Action:**
Spray the outer color layer.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Mix**: Gelcoat + 2% Catalyst.
2.  **Spray**: Keep gun 50cm from mold. Move parallel.
3.  **Thickness**: Target 0.6mm - 0.8mm.
4.  **Check**: Use the "Comb" gauge.
    *   *Too Thin*: You will see glass fibers later (Print-through).
    *   *Too Thick*: It will crack (Alligatoring).

   ------------------  <-- Mold Surface
   
   Move:  Left ----> Right
```

### STEP 3: The "Skin Coat" (The Waterproof Layer)
**Worker:** Laminators
**Action:**
The first layer of glass behind the gelcoat. MUST be perfect.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Wait**: Gelcoat must be "Tacky" (sticky like tape, but no color on finger).
2.  **Material**: Vinylester Resin + Chopped Strand Mat (CSM 300g).
3.  **Apply**:
    *   Wet the surface with resin.
    *   Lay the dry glass mat.
    *   Wet the mat until transparent.
    *   **ROLL OUT**: Use the metal roller to kill ALL air bubbles.
4.  **Inspect**: Look closely. Any white spot is an air bubble. Pop it.

   Glass Layer:   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Air Bubble:        ( O )  <-- BAD!
   
   Metal Roller:   ====[||||]====
   Action:         Push ---->
   Result:         Air goes out. Glass lies flat.
```

### STEP 4: Bulk Lamination (Building Strength)
**Worker:** Full Team
**Action:**
Adding the heavy layers (Biaxial/Unidirectional).

**Instruction:**
1.  **Stagger Joints**: Never put two edges of glass on top of each other. Overlap by 50mm, but stagger the seams by 100mm.
2.  **Wet Out**: Pour resin (don't splash). Spread with soft roller.
3.  **Consolidate**: Metal roller every layer.
4.  **Core (If used)**:
    *   Apply "Core Bedding Putty" (thick resin paste).
    *   Press foam squares into putty.
    *   Vacuum bag or put weights (sandbags) on top.

**VISUAL GUIDE: STAGGERED JOINTS**
```text
   Layer 2:   [_______________________]
   Layer 1:       [_______________________]
   
   Mold:      _________________________________
   
   Result:    Strong. No thick "hump" at the joint.
```

## 4. QUALITY CONTROL (QA) - THE "BUBBLE HUNT"

**Inspector:** Foreman
**Tools:** Flashlight, Coin.

1.  **Visual**: Shine light sideways. Shadows show bubbles.
2.  **Tap Test** (After Cure): Tap with a coin.
    *   *Sharp "Click"* = Good solid laminate.
    *   *Dull "Thud"* = Air void or delamination. **MARK WITH RED X.**

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES

*   **"Resin Rich"**: Too much resin. It's brittle and heavy. Glass should look like wet fabric, not a swimming pool.
*   **"Resin Starved"**: White, dry fibers visible. Weak.
*   **"Kick in the bucket"**: Mixing too much resin at once. It gets hot and hardens in the bucket. Mix small batches (5kg max).

---
**Next Step:** Let cure for 48 hours. Then [02_Structure_Grid](./02_Structure_Grid.md).
