## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Floor Preparation & Centerline
**Worker:** General Worker
**Action:**

1.  **Sweep and Clean**: Remove all dust, oil, and debris from the 30m x 10m area.
2.  **Find Center**: Measure the width of the hall. Mark the exact middle at the Front and Back.
3.  **Snap Line**: Use the Chalk Line to snap a line connecting Front and Back. This is the **Centerline (CL)**.
4.  **Mark Stations**: Starting from the Transom (Back), measure and mark every 1 meter (or as per plan) along the Centerline. Label them: `ST-0`, `ST-1`, `ST-2`...

```

**QA CHECK:**
*   [ ] Measure diagonal distance from corners to checking squareness (Pythagoras). A² + B² = C².

---

### STEP 2: Strongback Fabrication
**Worker:** Welder / Carpenter
**Action:**
Build the rigid frame that sits on the floor. It looks like a ladder.

**Specs:**
*   **Height**: 600mm - 800mm off ground (Working height).
*   **Width**: 1000mm (or 50% of hull beam).
*   **Level Tolerance**: +/- 1mm.

**Instruction:**
1.  Cut legs to rough height.
2.  Set up the two long longitudinal beams.
3.  Weld/Bolt cross-bracing every 2 meters.
4.  **CRITICAL**: Use the Laser Level to shim the legs until the top surface is DEAD LEVEL.
5.  Anchor legs to the concrete floor (Bolts).

      Top Beam (Steel/ d)  =======================================  <-- MUST BE LEVEL
                           |   |            |   |

      Floor (Uneven) ____/_______\________/_______\______
```

**QA CHECK:**
*   [ ] Place Spirit Level on top beam. Bubble must be EXACTLY in middle.
*   [ ] Check diagonal measurements of the frame box to ensure it is square.

### STEP 3: Station Mold Setup
**Worker:** Carpenter
**Action:**
Place the CNC-cut wooden frames (Stations) onto the Strongback.

**Instruction:**
1.  Identify Station #1 (`ST-1`).
2.  Place it on the Strongback at the `ST-1` mark on the floor.
3.  **Align Center**: The Centerline mark on the Station must match the Centerline on the Strongback.
4.  **Align Vertical**: Use a Plumb Bob or Digital Level to make sure the station is standing straight up (90 degrees).
5.  **Brace**: Screw temporary timber diagonals to hold it in place.

          |    v    |   <-- Plumb Bob hanging down
   _______|____X____|_______  <-- X mark on Floor (CL)
```

**QA CHECK:**
*   [ ] Plumb bob tip points exactly to the floor line.
*   [ ] Distance between ST-1 and ST-2 is exactly as per drawing (e.g., 1000mm).

### STEP 4: Battens & Fairing (For Male Mold)
**Worker:** Carpenter
**Action:**
Nail long, thin flexible wood strips (battens) along the stations to create the hull shape.

**Instruction:**
1.  Select knot-free pine strips (20mm x 40mm).
2.  Start at the Sheer (Top edge) and Keel (Bottom).
3.  Screw batten to every station.
4.  **Spacing**: Gap between battens should be small (approx 50-100mm).
5.  **Sight Check**: Look along the hull. It should be a smooth curve. No "bumps" or "dips".

**VISUAL GUIDE: BATTENS**
```text
   Station 1    Station 2    Station 3
      |            |            |
      |============|============|  <-- Batten
      |            |            |
      |============|============|  <-- Batten
      |            |            |
      |            |            |
```

**QA CHECK:**
*   [ ] Run your hand along the batten. If you feel a bump, sand the station high spot or shim the low spot.

## 4. FINAL INSPECTION CHECKLIST (Site Lead)

*   [ ] **Safety**: Fire extinguisher is mounted and visible?
*   [ ] **Strongback**: Is it anchored? Kick it hard - does it move? (It should not).
*   [ ] **Level**: Laser level check on all 4 corners of the jig.
*   [ ] **Stations**: Are they numbered correctly? (Check 1, 2, 3 sequence).
*   [ ] **Lighting**: Is the workspace bright enough to see pencil marks?

## 5. TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Floor is very uneven** | Do not just shim. Use hydraulic jack to lift strongback, pack with steel plates/grout. |
| **Station is wobbling** | Add more diagonal cross-braces (X-shape) to the strongback. |
| **Laser line is thick** | Use the center of the laser beam, or switch to a finer setting. |
