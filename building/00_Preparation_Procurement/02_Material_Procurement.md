## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Receiving Inspection (The "Gatekeeper")
**Worker:** Storekeeper
**Action:**
When the truck arrives, DO NOT sign until you check.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Count**: Compare Packing List vs. Physical Count.
2.  **Visual Check**: Look for dents, holes, or wet boxes.
3.  **Resin Check**: Look at the "Batch Number" and "Manufacturing Date" on the drum label.
    *   *Rule*: If date is > 3 months old, ALERT MANAGER.
4.  **Glass Check**: Ensure plastic wrapping is 100% sealed. If wrapped is torn, humidity gets in.

  |  Date: 2025-01-15  <---- CHECK THIS DATE!
  |__________________________|
         |        |

        |        |
```

**QA CHECK:**
*   [ ] No punctures in boxes?
*   [ ] Drums are not bulging or leaking?

### STEP 2: Storage - Resin & Chemicals
**Worker:** Storekeeper
**Action:**
Store chemicals to prevent fire and degradation.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Temperature**: Store in cool shade (20°C - 25°C). Avoid direct sun!
    *   *Sun = Resin cures in drum = Rock hard.*
2.  **Rotation**: Use "FIFO" (First In, First Out).
    *   *Mark the arrival date big on the side.*
3.  **Orientation**: Store drums upright on pallets (off the concrete).
4.  **Daily Stir**: Some additives settle. Roll the drums once a week if stored long.

```

### STEP 3: Storage - Fiberglass & Core
**Worker:** Storekeeper
**Action:**
Keep it DRY. Water is the enemy.

**Instruction:**
1.  **Core Foam**: Store flat. Do not stand sheets on edge (they warp).
2.  **Fiberglass Rolls**: Store horizontally (lying down).
    *   *Exception*: If box says "Store Vertical", follow box.
3.  **Moisture**: Keep humidity low.
4.  **Cover**: Keep plastic cover ON until the minute it is used. Dust on glass = Bad bonding.

   ==============           //  <-- Warps/Bends
   ==============          //
   [ Pallet ]             //
```

### STEP 4: Inventory Log
**Worker:** Storekeeper
**Action:**
Update the whiteboard or logbook.

**Instruction:**
1.  Write down exactly what came in.
2.  Assign a "Job Bin" number if it is for a specific part of the boat.

**Log Template:**
| Date | Item Name | Qty | Batch # | Expiry Date | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 10/10 | Resin VE | 200kg | B-101 | 12/2025 | Shelf A |

## 4. HANDLING RULES

1.  **Never** open a resin drum just to "look". Oxygen starts the aging.
2.  **Never** drag glass rolls on the floor. Carry them.
3.  **Always** wear gloves. Finger oils contaminate the glass.

## 5. TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Resin drum is hot** | Chemical reaction starting! Move to open air, call Fire Safety. |
| **Glass roll is wet** | Do not use for structural parts. Mark "SCRAP". |
| **Core sheet has dent** | Circle the dent with marker so builders see it. |

**Next Step:** Materials are ready. Proceed to [03_Team_Mobilization](./03_Team_Mobilization.md).
