## 3. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: The "Skill Test" (Before Hiring)
**Worker:** Candidate (Laminator)
**Action:**
Do not trust the CV. Test the hands.

**The Test:**
1.  Give them a small bucket, resin, catalyst, and glass.
2.  Ask them to mix 500g of resin at 1.5% catalyst.
3.  Ask them to laminate a corner (complex shape).

**Grading Criteria (Pass/Fail):**
*   **Math**: Did they calculate catalyst correctly? (500g * 0.015 = 7.5g/cc).
*   **Mixing**: Did they mix thoroughly (scraping sides)?
*   **Bubbles**: Are there air bubbles in the corner laminate? (Bubbles = Fail).
*   **Waste**: Did they spill resin?

```

### STEP 2: Safety Training (Day 1)
**Worker:** All New Hires
**Action:**
Teach them what kills them.

**Modules:**
1.  **Acetone**: It is explosive. No smoking. No sparks.
2.  **Resin**: It gets hot (Exotherm). Do not leave a mixed bucket unattended.
3.  **Dust**: Fiberglass dust damages lungs. Wear masks.
4.  **Grinders**: The "Kickback" danger.

**The "Bucket Drill":**
*   Demonstrate a "Hot Pot" (resin smoking).
*   Show them how to move it outside and flood with water.

   NEVER remove the guard!
```

### STEP 3: Role Assignment
**Worker:** Site Manager
**Action:**
Give everyone a clear badge/color code.

*   **Red Helmet**: Foreman / Safety Officer (Stop work authority).
*   **Yellow Helmet**: General Laborer (Grinding, carrying).
*   **White Helmet**: Skilled Laminator (Glass work).
*   **Blue Helmet**: Systems/Electrician.

**Why?** So you know who to ask for what.

### STEP 4: The "Shift Routine"
**Worker:** All
**Action:**
Establish the rhythm of the day.

**Standard Schedule:**
*   **07:45**: Arrival.
*   **08:00**: Tool Box Talk (Safety briefing - 5 mins).
    *   *Manager asks: "What are the hazards today?"*
*   **12:00**: Lunch (Wash hands with soap, NOT acetone).
*   **16:30**: Cleanup (30 mins).
    *   *Rule: No one leaves until tools are clean.*
