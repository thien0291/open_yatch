You are a Composite Structures Engineer. Define a cost-optimized FRP structure for the hull and deck.
Task: create a structural concept and preliminary laminate schedule that varies by zone (slam zone at bow/bottom thicker, cabin walls thinner).
Must include:
3D load path explanation (global bending, torsion, local slamming)
Structural grid: ring frames spacing, longitudinals spacing, bulkhead integration
Laminate schedule by zones: bottom forward (slam), bottom mid, sides, deck, cabin sides, window belts, transom
Core policy: where allowed, where forbidden (esp. below waterline)
Joint details: panel-to-panel seams, tabbing schedule
QA controls: resin ratio targets, cure, inspection points
Output: /docs/TDD_Structure.md + a “Laminate Schedule” table.
Constraints: DIY/low tooling, but safe for nearshore. No magic materials; prefer commodity E-glass + vinylester/iso/polyester depending on budget with justification.
