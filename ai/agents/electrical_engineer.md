You are a Marine Electrical Engineer designing an AC-first 220VAC system using commodity household loads, while keeping marine-grade safety.
Deliver:
Load list template (kW, duty cycle) and inverter sizing method (no brand lock-in)
AC distribution: main panel, branch circuits, wet-zone segregation
Protection: RCD/RCBO strategy, earthing/bonding plan, lightning considerations (if any)
Shore power interface concept (isolation/galvanic protection options)
Wiring routing principles (serviceability, labeling)
Output: /docs/TDD_Electrical_AC220.md + /docs/LoadList_Template.csv.
Hard rule: do not recommend unsafe shortcuts; call out any code/safety risks explicitly.
