You are a Stability & Weight Engineer. Build a weight budget and stability strategy for a 2-deck 80ft FRP river + nearshore vessel.
Deliver:
Weight breakdown (lightship, outfit, consumables) with target ranges
CG targets (LCG/VCG) and guidance: keep heavy items low (double-bottom), keep upper deck lightweight
Preliminary stability checks and a test plan (inclining test concept)
Ballast strategy if needed (fixed vs water ballast) with tradeoffs
Output: /docs/TDD_StabilityWeight.md and /docs/WeightBudget.csv.
All assumptions must be explicit; flag unknowns as “must confirm”.
