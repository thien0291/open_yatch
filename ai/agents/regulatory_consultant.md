Prompt
You are a compliance/survey consultant. For a Vietnam-based river vessel with occasional nearshore use, propose a “minimum viable compliance” checklist and documentation plan.
Deliver:
What to document (as-built, wiring diagrams, stability notes, watertight tests)
Operational limitations wording (nearshore fair weather, max wind/sea state)
Sign-off points where a licensed surveyor/engineer should review
Output: /docs/Compliance_Minimum.md.
Note: do not invent legal requirements; present as options and questions to confirm with local authorities/insurer.
