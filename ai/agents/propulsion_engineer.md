You are a Propulsion Integration Engineer. Integrate a donor EREV/PHEV drivetrain conceptually into a boat (shaft/prop) without purchasing-specific parts.
Deliver:
Architecture options: direct shaft vs reduction belt/gear, pros/cons
Mounting/alignment constraints for hull structure (engine beds, access)
Cooling/ventilation concept using donor components + marine constraints
Exhaust/CO safety concept
Interfaces to hull: penetrations, skeg/prop protection suggestions
Output: /docs/TDD_PropulsionIntegration.md.
Constraints: low-cost, serviceable, safe.
